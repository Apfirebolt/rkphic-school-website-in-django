# Website for a school ⚡️

## Project Briefing

A simple website for a school which my friend owns.

Made with ❤️ by **[@apfirebolt](https://github.com/Apfirebolt/)**

Please find me [here](https://apgiiit.com/)
## Features

- Demonstrates use of Redux store management for API data in React using Redux toolkit.
- Demonstrates use of Blueprint UI for React Components like cards, buttons, accordions and more.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
* [BluePrint UI React](https://blueprintjs.com/)

## Project setup

Simply install node modules for the React app and you're done at least for the development mode.

## Issues

API data for the character section is far from complete, there is data available only for 15-20 characters from the franchise. API developers might address this later after which this would be updated. But, that is not a big issue.

## Future Updates

- Expect UI improvements in near future for this app as I get more familiar with Blueprint UI.
- Search bar to be added for searching spells, ingredients and more.

## Project Screenshots

Would be added later
